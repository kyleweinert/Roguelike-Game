This program can generate random dungeons based off either a user generated
seed or a software generated seed. It can also save and load maps if the user
specifies that.

It generates distance maps for tunneling and non tunneling monsters to the player.

Using the "--nummon" flag and an integer you can choose how many monsters you would like to spawn.

Player can be controlled with the numpad. Monster list can be opened with 'm' and closed by pressing 'esc' twice.
